# Rock_Paper_Scissor_UsingOpenCV_MediaPipe
This is a Machine learing Project for my University course. I use openCV and mediapipe as a pretrained model for detecting samples(Rock,Paper,Scissor).Then i take a random input from the machine and compare with user input gesture. And as per the game rock,paper,scissor  makes a decision who has win the game.
